Unlimited Edition is anextension of Enterprise Edition and includes more storage space, premiersupport, more objects, increased API limits, and so on.

There I call admin.auth().createUser() to set the user credentials for the Auth user as well as for the user document that I add to Cloud Firestore. </p><p>My problem is that I hash the password value on the frontend before the HTTP request to Functions is sent. I do this because of safety reasons. But how can I revert the hash, so I can write the raw password into createUser()?</p><p>Actually I save the hashed password and after that I can't login with the created user, because it's the hashed value.</p><p>My function in Cloud Functions:exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {</p><pre><code>try {    const user = req.body;    console.log(user.password);    const userRecord = await admin.auth().createUser({        email: user.mail,        emailVerified: false,        password: user.password,        displayName: user.firstname + ' ' + user.lastname,        photoURL: ""http://www.example.com/12345678/photo.png"",        disabled: false    }).then(async (userRecord) =&gt; {        console.log(userRecord.password);        console.log(userRecord);        return  await userCollection.doc(userRecord.uid).set({            uid: userRecord.uid,            firstname: user.firstname,            lastname: user.lastname,            photoURL: userRecord.photoURL,            dateOfBirth: user.dateOfBirth,            sex: user.sex,            city: user.city,            activities: user.activities,            offers: user.offers        })      })      console.log(""Successfully created new user:"");      return res.status(200).send(userRecord);    }catch (error) {    console.log(""Error creating new user:"", error);        return res.send(false);}</code></pre><p>The hashing on the frontend looks like this (using ts-md5):</p><pre><code> password: Md5.hashStr(this.registerForm.value.registerFormPassword)</code></pre><p>Is there a method to reverse the hash or a method from Firebase Auth to hash the password on the client side and a counterpart to revert it on the server side? </p><p>I searched the internet for answers but can't find anything to this topic, so could it be that this is absolutely the wrong way with hashing the password? And if so, what's good practise in such cases?</p>"

__label__Cloud	"<p>I am using Cloud Functions to handle read/write to Cloud Firestore on the server side. The Cloud Functions are triggered by clients in the web app using HTTPS callable function.</p><p>When calling a Cloud Functions using HTTPS, there is a parameter sent from the client call ""context"" that carries user auth information. For example, a Cloud Functions on the server can look like this:</p><pre><code>// Saves a message to the Firebase Realtime Database but sanitizes the text by removing swearwords.exports.addMessage = functions.https.onCall((data, context) =&gt; {  // ...});</code></pre><p>However, since <code>context</code> is passed by the client, and the client could pass in a manipulated ID token, do I need to always perform a ID token verification before trusting and using something like <code>context.auth.uid</code> to interact with my database?</p><p>The ID token verification I am talking about is this:</p><pre><code>// idToken comes from the client appadmin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken)  .then(function(decodedToken) {    var uid = decodedToken.uid;    // ...  }).catch(function(error) {    // Handle error  });</code></pre><p>Essentially, I want to know if Firebase performs ID token verification automatically when passing <code>context</code> using https call and therefore I can go ahead and trust that if the client has manipulated <code>context</code>, the https call will fail due to token verification failing. Or, do I need to explicitly do a manual ID token verification on the server every single time to check the integrity of <code>context</code>, since the client can easily insert a manipulated token using the browser's devtools or something like that.</p>"

You can either create an http request to firebase, or you can use web side firebase. If you're using web side firebase, you would just update the document in firebase (note that you wouldn't need to import firestore in react if you are doing a fetch request.)</p><p>the react way involves something like this:</p><pre><code>const ref = firebase.firestore().collection('newsletter').doc(ID);ref.get().then((doc) =&gt; {    if(doc.exists()){        ref.update({verified: true});  });</code></pre><p>The logic for interacting with firestore is very similar on the backend with the Admin API, however you'll wrap it in an HTTP request in cloud-functions:</p><pre><code>exports.verify = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) =&gt; {  // admin api call with req params or body});</code></pre><p>With the above code you can either navigate directly here from the email, responding with HTML directly, or you can call it via a fetch request in the react app like <code>fetch(""https://example.com/verify/ID"").then(...)</code>.</p><p>If you want more details about any one of the above methods I described, post it as a separate question if you can't find it on SO, let me know, and I'll do my best to answer. </p>"
