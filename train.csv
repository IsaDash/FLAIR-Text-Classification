A user has logged onto a terminal, they want to access a particular page within a cloud based software. To get into the platform of the cloud based software (before accessing the desired page above) they need to click on a link that simultaneously authenticates via AD and opens the platform page (due to the fact the have already signed onto the terminal). Then from the platform page they would navigate to the desired page. </p><p>The issue here is that they need to open the platform page first before they can click on a link that accesses the actual page they want to use. </p><p>From a user experience in certain instances, i want to bypass the platform homepage and send them straight to the relevant page (inside of this cloud based application) to streamline for efficiency purposes for a better user experience (say if clicking on a link from the work intranet that takes them to the cloud based applications desired page without having to open the platform window). </p><p>I hope that makes sense.

Note that I am targeting every ordinary family user, so that they can always get rid of the host around and enjoy a better entertainment, office and development environment than now.1.

I've seen plenty if smallapps that let you do that kind of thing. But then I did some initial exploringinto Google drive. Half of the guides I read seem normal, but then the otherhalf... I'm running into Google telling me to ""enable Billing"" in theseguides. When I look at the prices, it's like $1,000+ a month for these massivestorage services. Good lord... I just wanna let my users upload some sillypictures to their personal Google drives.So all the guides are vaguely interconnected and I can't be certain what'swhat. I don't want to waste my life on guides that will tell me 20 hours downthe road that I REALLY need to give google 1000 dollars a month for somethingso basic.So, am I crazy, or what? Can a dev who's run into this question before confirmif my intended feature is possible without selling google my left kidney? Idon't mind doing the research and coding myself, but I gotta know if it's awaste of time to even start.Thanks for the help everyone."

There are many gatewaysolutions available such as [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul),[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/), etc. but in this article, we willspecifically discuss [Spring Cloud Gateway - a reactiveGateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) built upon ProjectReactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot 2.0.First, we will start with an introduction of Spring Cloud Gateway and thendiscuss the features of it that makes it the best fit as a cloud gateway.After that, we will look into the gateway flow with different examples ofusing predicates for routing, pre-filters, global filters to modify therequest and response header and body along with[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) support. In the end, we willcreate a simple example project to demonstrate these capabilities withdiscovery server using Netflix, multiple microservices and Spring CloudGateway routing requests to these different microservices downstream.## Blocking vs Non-Blocking GatewayA Blocking gateway such as Zuul1 requires as many threads as no of requests tohandle requests coming to an API gateway and hence a lot of resources isrequired to handle these requests. Any extra requests simply sit in the queueand wait until a working thread completes its execution. Whereas in case ofnon-blocking, the main thread is always available to serve the request andother multiple threads process those requests asynchronously in the backgroundand once the request is completely processed the response is returned. Hencenon-blocking model requires a less no of resources to serve the same amount ofrequests as compared to blocking gateway.Here is an example of [spring cloud Netflix with Zuul as GatewayProvider](https://www.devglan.com/spring-cloud/spring-netflix-zuul).Spring cloud gateway is a non-blocking reactive gateway similar to Zuul2 butspring cloud does not provide any out of the box integration with Zuul2.Here is the [performance benchmark of Spring Cloudgateway](https://github.com/spencergibb/spring-cloud-gateway-bench).## Spring Cloud Gateway ArchitectureBelow is a simple architecture diagram of Spring Cloud. In the later sections,we will discuss the different components involved in it.![spring-cloud-gateway-architecture](https://i.imgur.com/2N8AgtH.png)Once a request reaches to the gateway, the first thing gateway does is tomatch the request with each of the available route based on the predicatedefined. Once, the route has matched the request moves to web handler and thefilters will be applied to the request. There are many out of the box filtersprovided by the gateway itself to modify the request header as well as thebody. Pre-filters are applied specifically to a route whereas global filterscan be applied to all the route request. Global filters can be applied toperform authentication and authorization of all the request at one place.Once the response is generated by the downstream service, the post filter canbe used to modify the response such as to apply checksum in the responseheader to all the responses to ensure the response is not tempered due tomiddle man attack.Below is an example of a route that has a predicate defined to match all therequest URL with `/api/v1/queue/**` and apply a pre-filter to rewrite thepath. There is another filter applied to modify the request header and thenroute the request to load balanced FIRST-SERVICE.            builder.routes()                    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.rewritePath(""/api/v1/first/(?.*)"", ""/${remains}"")                                            .addRequestHeader(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header"")                            )                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""queue-service""))                        .build();    Below is the equivalent .yaml configuration.            spring:      cloud:        gateway:          routes:          - id: first-service            uri: lb://FIRST-SERVICE            predicates:            - Path=/api/v1/first/**            filters:            - RewritePath=/api/v1/first/(?.*), /$\{remains}            - AddRequestHeader=X-first-Header, first-service-header        ## Handler MappingThis is the first component where all the requests hit. Handler mapping looksinto each route that is defined and tries to match with each predicate definedin the route. After the match, handler mapping routes the request to thatmatched route.In the above example, we have only defined a path predicate to match therequest. There are a couple of other predicates out of the box to define ourroute such as Host, Date/Time, Method, Headers, Query Params, Cookies, bodyetc.### Path Roue PredicateWith path predicate, we can match the request with URI path. For example,below route is matched against the URl - localhost:8080/api/v1/first/users androutes to load balanced first-service service.            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                             .id(""first-service""))                        .build();    ### Host Route PredicateWith the Host route predicate, we can match Host header with any givenpattern.            .route(r -> r.host(""**.devglan.com"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                        .build();    ### Date/Time Route PredicateThis predicate can be used to match the route request with any givendate/time. We can use Before, After or Between to match with the date/time.            .route(r -> r.before(ZonedDateTime.now())                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                        .build();    ### Method Route PredicateWith this predicate, we match the HTTP request method type such as GET, POST,etc.            .route(r -> r.method(HttpMethod.POST)                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                        .build();    ### Header Route PredicateHeader route predicate is used to match the request with the header params.            .route(r -> r.header(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    ### Query Param Route PredicateThis route predicate is used to match the request with query parameter passedin the request URI.            .route(r -> r.query(""refer"", ""email"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    ### Cookies Route PredicateThe Cookie Route Predicate Factory takes two parameters, the cookie name and aregular expression. This predicate matches cookies that have the given nameand the value matches the regular expression.            .route(r -> r.cookie(""chocolate"", ""ch.p"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    ## Web Handler FiltersAs discussed above, we can have pre-filters, global filters and post-flters.There are many filters that are provided by the gateway out of the box and italso provides flexibility to define our custom filters that can be eitherapplied to a specific route or to all the request coming to the gateway.### Pre-FiltersPre-filters are route specific which can be used to modify all the elements ofthe incoming request such as Headers, Path, Rate Limiting, Cookies, Hystrix,Moddify Body etc.#### AddRequestHeader WebFilterThis filter is used to add extra header element in the incoming request. Ittakes a name and value parameter.            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                             .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    #### RewritePath WebFilterIt is used to rewrite the incoming request URI path. The RewritePathGatewayFilter Factory takes a path regexp parameter and a replacementparameter. This uses Java regular expressions for a flexible way to rewritethe request path. Below is the Java config.            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.rewritePath(""/api/v1/first/(?.*)"", ""/${remains}""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    #### Rate Limiting WebFilterIt is mainly used to control the amount of incoming request to the server.Thisfilter uses a RateLimiter implementation to determine if the current requestis allowed to proceed. If it is not, a status of HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests(by default) is returned.This filter takes an optional keyResolver parameterand parameters specific to the rate limiter - replenishRate, capacity, andkeyResolverName**ReplenishRate** \- Defines number of requests per second allowed.**Capacity** \- Defines bursting capacity that is allowed. 2 consecutivebursts will result in dropped requests (HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests)**KeyResolverName** \- Custom implementation of KeyResolver interface.            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.requestRateLimiter().configure(c -> c.setRateLimiter(customRateLimiter)))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    Here, customRateLimiter is the implementation of KeyResolver interface.#### Hystrix WebFilterThe Hystrix GatewayFilter allows you to introduce circuit breakers to yourgateway routes, protecting your services from cascading failures and allowingyou to provide fallback responses in the event of downstream failures. TheHystrix GatewayFilter Factory requires a single name parameter, which is thename of the HystrixCommand.            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.hystrix(h -> h.setName(""Hystrix"").setFallbackUri(""forward:/fallback"")))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();                @RestController    @RequestMapping(""/fallback"")    public class FallbackController {            @GetMapping(""/"")        public ResponseEntity fallback(){            return ResponseEntity.ok(Arrays.asList());        }    }    #### Modify Request Body FilterThis filter can be used to modify the request body before it is sentdownstream by the Gateway.            @Bean    public RouteLocator routes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {        return builder.routes()            .route(""rewrite_request_obj"", r -> r.host(""*.rewriterequestobj.org"")                .filters(f -> f.prefixPath(""/httpbin"")                    .modifyRequestBody(String.class, Hello.class, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,                        (exchange, s) -> return Mono.just(new Hello(s.toUpperCase())))).uri(uri))            .build();    }        static class Hello {        String message;            public Hello() { }            public Hello(String message) {            this.message = message;        }            public String getMessage() {            return message;        }            public void setMessage(String message) {            this.message = message;        }    }    ### Global FilterGlobal filters cana be applied conditionally to all routes. The differentglobal filters are Netty Router, Web Sockets, Load Balancer, Metrics.### Post FiltersPost filters are used to add, modify, remove or rewrite response header orbody.#### Add Response Header Filter            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.addResponseHeader(""payload-size"", ""12""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();        #### Remove Response Header Filter            .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.removeResponseHeader(""payload-size""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    ## ConclusionIn this article, we discussed about the spring cloud gateway and its differentcomponents such as routes, predicates, filters with example. In the nexttutorial of [Spring Cloud Gateway Example](https://www.devglan.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway-example) we will implement these theories and buildan application with microservice architecture using Spring Cloud Gateway anddemonstrate working examples on web filters to modify request and responsebody."

Future version of addon will have a ""allow allclouds in this site"" button in UI for excluding some sites from blockingrules.Example 2: If ""Block Amazon"" is toggled ON in Popup, let's say a website ishosted ""on-premise (not in cloud)"", but has some ""resources"" like images,video and scripts hosted on Amazon AWS cloud, only those ""3rd party"" resourcesare blocked. ""3rd party"" = these resources. ""1st party"" = site in address bar+ resources delivered from same domain on-premise server.\- By default, in version 0.0.1.x, the toggle state ON or OFF in popup menu isnot persisted across browser restarts. When browser starts, all 5 toggles areset to OFF , i.e allow connections to all 5 cloud by default. You have theoption to open popup menu and toggle ON or OFF against each cloud that youwish to block or allow.[Refer Source codehere](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/e20e680ca6324d802f83e16528aa012ce67f3ad245b3047bbdd2a5918a1fbc5c/https%3A//gitlab.com/gkrishnaks/cloud-firewall)[This addon was selected for inclusion in **Humane Tech AwesomeList**](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a109e318604c3c9b569c234376e21b2e75b2cca5dde657bb641cb1196b7843db/https%3A//github.com/gkrishnaks/awesome-humane-tech) **Inspiration:**\- The inspiration behind the creation of this addon was the ""Life without thetech giants"" series by Kashmir Hill and Dhruv Mehrotra. Read it here :[Gizmodoseries](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/e830511f196ed3a6b872a4c75e498f818fd73b879b4c2dc50f34514d1892cac9/https%3A//gizmodo.com/life-without-the-tech-giants-1830258056)and Dhruv Mehrotra published the VPN tool in his[ Github](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/c128900c29571aa9c9f3a8b934fa6bf3f46cb97ac43692da0a83f0ebeb8b9f0a/https%3A//github.com/dmehrotra/GoodbyeBigFive)\- I used the AS.csv from his repository and the BASH script to generate thelist of IPv4/IPv6 CIDR blocks/ranges owned by each of the 5 companies **Purpose:**\-_Experience_the web as though major cloud companies are not available, so that we canvisualize how much of the WWW is hosted in some cloud providers\-_Research:_similar to Kashmir Hill's series, you can conduct research on how many timesyour browser connects to major top 5 tech companies when you browse the WWW.(Please let the developer know if this addon helps with your research)\-_Website Testing:_If you are a website developer or site owner, and have some resources likejavascript or images or videos hosted in Cloud providers like AWS or Azure orGoogle Cloud, use this addon for testing your website behaviour for the casewhere the whole Cloud region goes down. (Please let the developer know if thisaddon helps with testing your websites) **How does it work?**\- Addon comes bundled with a list of all IP address ranges CIDR blocks inboth IPV4 and IPV6 owned by top 5 tech companies. Refer ""Inspiration"" sectionabove for the source of this list.\- Whenever a page is loaded, all the resources in the page from address barURL to embedded images, javascript files and other resources (like video) areresolved from DNS to IP address, and the IP address is checked against theknown list of IP ranges owned by each company\- If ""Block {company}"" switch is toggled ON in popup, the connection isblocked if the resolved IP is within a known range of the selected company.\- Addon uses local offline storage to store a cache of hostnames so thatsubsqeuent page loads are faster. Domainnames are stored as base64 SHA256digest sums. User has the option to delete this cache OR disable cache storagefrom Settings page\- In future versions, we will research an optional setting to AES256 encryptthis cache\- When caching is enabled, cache is compressed and written to disk once everyfour minutes to avoid multiple disk writes\-*****NOTE**:**it uses the[DNS.resolve WebExtAPI](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/ca8846835a9788a81627bdafdc960705a49435c180a470318848970b3643afd4/https%3A//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns/resolve)made available by Firefox to WebExtensions. The implementation of this API isinside browser, and browser may use SYSTEM's DNS resolver to resolve DNS toIP. Therefore only the official Firefox versions from Mozilla are supported,namely ""Firefox"" from[mozilla.org](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/5688239e82f438f30854055e084cb2233d530bee4a660bb381f11d318ec27d8f/https%3A//mozilla.org)or Mozilla's ""Firefox For Android"" from Play store.\- Hence it's**not recommended**to use this addon with other Firefox variants, like TBB, Palemoon, Waterfoxetc. Also why it's**not recommended**to use with any ""proxy addons"" you may find in Mozilla Addons store.

In my opinion there are many different solutions on how to build or how to design MCM's, but no finished solution.</p><p>The next point was, what does MCM platform mean? Because middlewares are described as a platform of complex software system, which used as service to loosely couple other software components for file exchange.

Since the annotations of point cloud data is an expensiveand time-consuming process, therefore recently the utilization of simulatedenvironments and 3D LiDAR sensors for this task started to get somepopularity. With simulated sensors and environments, the process for obtainingan annotated synthetic point cloud data became much easier. However, thegenerated synthetic point cloud data are still missing the artifacts usuallyexist in point cloud data from real 3D LiDAR sensors. As a result, theperformance of the trained models on this data for perception tasks whentested on real point cloud data is degraded due to the domain shift betweensimulated and real environments. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a domainadaptation framework for bridging this gap between synthetic and real pointcloud data. Our proposed framework is based on the deep cycle-consistentgenerative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) architecture. We have evaluated theperformance of our proposed framework on the task of vehicle detection from abirdÛªs eye view (BEV) point cloud images coming from real 3D LiDAR sensors.The framework has shown competitive results with an improvement of more than7% in average precision score over other baseline approaches when tested onreal BEV point cloud images.

__label__Cloud	Hello All,  I'm running into a situation that I need to plan for. We have two datacenters...one production and the other fail-over. In our production datacenter, we have a about 20 vendors that terminate VPN tunnels on our mainfirewall. In the event of a disaster fail-over, we would need to swing thoseconnections over to the secondary data center. What's the best option ofaccomplishing this, without calling each vendor and giving them a new ip tobuild their tunnel's to us? Is there a solution where I could have themterminate to a vpn concentrator that is extracted from on prem? I guesssomething like a global load balancer, just with vpn connectivity....

The main things i want itfor is performance alerting, monitoring (including scriptable), and patchmanagement.  We are not a huge network, only looking at 50-100 endpoints and i know i canachieve all these things with different inbuilt tools and GPOs but using aplatform to hande it all is much easier.  I was looking at Pulseway, but it looks like you need to go into eachendpoints console to setup monitoring alerts etc which is pretty cumbersomeand defeats the purpose.I have been using Itarian for some workstations patching in a trial and itseems to be working ok, but being free and potential lack of support has behesitant in committing to it for our DC.    ThanksTy

What I want is that all URLs to be redirected to <code>/wordpress</code>, so that when visitors request <code>www.example.com</code>, they will be redirected to the WordPress app. And just when they give <code>www.example.com/could</code> will be redirected to the cloud app. I have used a <code>.htaccess</code> file, and it looks like the following</p><pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;RewriteEngine onRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/Cloud/RewriteBase /RewriteRule ^(.*)$ wrdpress/$1 [L] &lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre><p>The cloud app works fine, the start page of WordPress too, but whenever I navigate to a post the redirect breaks with <code>ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS</code>. The problem as I can tell is that when I try to open <code>www.example.com/2019/04/some_post</code> the server try to find a sub directory <code>2019</code> in the WordPress directory, which doesn't exist.</p>

__label__Cloud	<p>I am not sure why do you need it for python as this feature already comes with One Drive.</p><p>Microsoft already introduced a new OneDrive feature that will make it easier to recover from ransomware attacks. Files Restore is making its way over from OneDrive for Business to personal OneDrive accounts. The catch is youÛªll need an Office 365 subscription to get access to the new Files Restore feature. OneDrive users can now use it to simply restore files from any point in time within the last 30 days. If you accidentally delete a file youÛªll be able to restore it, or if you make some bad changes and want to roll back to an earlier copy.</p><p>Microsoft is marketing the Files Restore feature as a good way to protect against ransomware attacks that lock files on a local PC, and often try to delete copies that are stored in synced folders ÛÒ replicating those changes in the cloud. WeÛªve seen a number of these attacks recently, and victims have been forced to pay money to try and get their files back.</p><p>If OneDrive detects mass deletion of cloud files, Microsoft will alert users through an email or mobile / desktop notification and a recovery process will let you quickly restore to a time before the ransomware attack.</p><p><strong>OneDrive Files Restore</strong></p><p>Alongside this new Files Restore feature, Microsoft is also adding password protected sharing links for OneDrive to make it a little more secure when you share out sensitive files or folders. Outlook.com is also getting updated with email encryption for Office 365 subscribers. The email encryption can be enabled on individual messages, and Outlook.com will even prompt you to encrypt emails if it detects information like social security numbers in messages. Recipients will be able to read the messages in Outlook.com, Outlook for iOS and Android, the Windows Mail app, or just by visiting a link in the email if the level of security at the recipient doesnÛªt meet MicrosoftÛªs encrypted connection standards. Outlook.com users will also be able to prevent recipients from forwarding or copying emails sent from the service.</p>

__label__Cloud	"<p>Ok, I'll answer this question myself, in case someone else may need that in the future.<br>Actually, I managed to implement it finally - even though the help from the creators of all of this was rather disappointing.</p><p><strong>TLDR</strong> - the solution is here: <a href=""https://github.com/TheFonz2017/Spring-Cloud-Netflix-Ribbon-CF-Routing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/TheFonz2017/Spring-Cloud-Netflix-Ribbon-CF-Routing</a></p><p>The solution:</p><ul><li>Allows to use Ribbon on Cloud Foundry, overriding the Go-Router's load balancing.</li><li>Adds a custom routing header to Ribbon load balancing requests (including retries) to instruct CF's Go-Router to route requests to service instance selected by Ribbon (rather than its own).</li><li>Shows how to intercept load balancing requests</li></ul><p>The key to understanding this is that Spring Cloud has its own LoadBalancer framework, for which Ribbon is just one possible implementation. It is also important to understand, that Ribbon is only used as a load balancer <strong>not</strong> as an HTTP client. In other words, Ribbon's <code>ILoadBalancer</code> instance is only used to select the service instance from the server list.

Hence, a company with some hardware/full fledged datacenter can run OpenStack to provide a public cloud computing service/run aprivate cloud for internal use etc. Correct me if Im wrong here.Im confused about the usage of terms like controller nodes, compute nodes whenit comes to Openstack. Since openstack is a collection of softwaretools(literally some python packages as I see on github), what do these termsmean here? Does a compute node mean a node/machine runnning exclusivelyNova(the compute component of OpenStack), and similarly for controlller andstorage nodes?

__label__Cloud	<p>In order to convert an unorganized 3d point cloud into a 2d image, you have to (to the best of my knowledge) do a grid raycast:</p><p>To simulate a real camera, you would pick some point that is a distance away from what you are imaging (your target) and then you would set up a grid of points between it (camera point) and your target center.  The grid should be in the plane normal to the vector between the target and camera.  The width and height (in conjunction with the distance between camera and grid) of that grid will set up your FOV (the angle in x and y that your camera will see).  The number of points in rows and columns will set up your resolution.  The final step is to raycast through all the points on the grid (in order) to create an organized 2d image.  To raycast, you simply calculate the normalized vector from the camera to any given grid point and then progressively add that vector (times your search step length which is likely about the same as your search radius) to the point (moving the point towards your target) and checking if there are any points from the target cloud within some radius at each step.  If you find a target inside the radius, record that intensity into your image and move on to the next grid point.  Make sure you put a limit on how far the ray can cast (the distance between your camera and furthest target point for instance).  Although you could just use a static search radius based on your known cloud resolution of your target, you could also be fancy and make the radius scale larger, linearly correlated to distance from camera (this would be more elegant and correct to how a camera actually works).</p><p>*To clarify, drawing the grid is not actually necessary as it can all be done with applying appropriate rotations to the normal vector to get all the projection vectors.  The concept of a grid is just much easier to visualize.</p><p>One final note is that this is not real world, so you could do another thing, a parallel raycast: Much the same as before but instead of a camera point you just create the grid and then project along the grid's surface normal for all points (so they move parallel to eachother instead of spreading out pyramidally).  This does some pretty interesting things  (specifically with edges and object occlusion) and could be useful depending on what you need this image for.</p>
