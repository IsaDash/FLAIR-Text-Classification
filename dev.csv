I want to place the transformable node to its last transformation(position, rotation, scaling) once the cloud anchor is resolved. I am storing the transformations locally (position, rotation, scaling) . For some reason only the scale and rotation were consistent. The position would always be the first tap position and not the last localPosition of the transformable node. </p><p>I tried logging the local transformation values and found that the localPosition changes back to (0,0,0) once I am done translating the node. </p><p>To my understanding ARCore has a hierarchy based node structure. And the transformable node is the child of the cloud anchor and anchors are immutable. So it should have a LocalPosition with respect parent anchor. Why is the localPosition fluctuating when the node is being moved and goes to (0,0,0) at the end of it. Is there anything I have not gone through? Thanks in advance.</p>

__label__Cloud	<p>I have a few common approaches to Cloud Functions that transform the data:</p><ol><li><p>Write the transformed data to a different document than the one that triggers the Cloud Function. This is by far the easier approach, since there is no additional code needed - and thus I can't make any mistakes in it. It also means there is no additional trigger, so you're not paying for that extra invocation.</p></li><li><p>Use granular triggers to ensure my Cloud Function only gets called when it needs to actually do some work. For example, many of my functions only need to run when the document gets created, so by using an <code>onCreate</code> trigger I ensure my code only gets run once, even if it then ends up updating the newly created document.</p></li><li><p>Write the transformed data into the existing document. In that case I make sure to have the checks for whether the transformation is needed in place before I write the actual code for the transformation. I prefer to not add flag fields, but use the existing data for this check.</p><p>A recent example is where I update an amount in a document, which then needs to be fanned out to all users:</p><pre><code>exports.fanoutAmount = functions.firestore.document('users/{uid}').onWrite((change, context) =&gt; {  let old_amount = change.before &amp;&amp; change.before.data() &amp;&amp; change.before.data().amount ? change.before.data().amount : 0;  let new_amount = change.after.data().amount;  if (old_amount !== new_amount) {    // TODO: fan out to all documents in the collection  }});</code></pre></li></ol>
